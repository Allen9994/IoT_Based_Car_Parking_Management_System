# IoT Based Car Parking Management System
Technology enabled functional prototype of a parking lot, designed to resolve many of the common driver’s obstacles when it comes to parking their vehicle in a public compound. 
Objectives of the project include: minimize the traffic congestion inside a parking area, ease the process of parking, facilitate the parking fee transaction, assist the parking lot administrator with daily traffic information and revenue generated, reduce carjacking and lower the air pollution. The microcontrollers adopted are Arduino MEGA and NodeMCU.
The system notifies a car driver of free slots available in a parking lot before entering the driveway of the parking space using mobile application. A boom barrier operated by the system controls the flow of the vehicles as it is determined by the free slots available as well as the congestion level inside the space. An obligatory driver account and credit balance is validated to authorize entry. Contactless transaction is accomplished automatically once inside and the driver is informed of the nearest free spot available along with the directions to the nearest slot using mobile applications. While attempting to exit the lot, the system notifies the driver if the driveway is blocked/congested. A bill produced to the driver informs them of the parked time and their total balance remaining using the app. The information regarding the entry and exit of each driver is recorded and stored using PHP and SQL servers and the administrator website displays all the relevant information concerned with the parking lot. 
An LCD display informs the drivers with adequate information, Blynk app provides smartphone interface, phpMyAdmin provides Web-app for the administrator and Telegram provides messaging capabilities.
